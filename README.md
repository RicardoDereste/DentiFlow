# 🦷 DentiFlow Clinic Website (React & Professional UX)

## 📘 About the Project

**DentiFlow** is a modern, high-performance dental clinic website built with **React**. It serves as a comprehensive digital storefront for a professional clinic, offering an intuitive user experience across five key pages: Home, Services, About Us, FAQ, and Contact.

The primary focus of this build was to balance **aesthetic professional design** with **technical reliability**. This involved creating a custom, accessible mobile navigation system, fine-tuning responsive CSS grids for clinical service showcases, and integrating a functional Google Maps and contact system.
